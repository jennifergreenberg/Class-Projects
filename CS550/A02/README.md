This project is an expansion of the Tileboard class project in which an NPuzzle class is used to find the solution to a randomized n-puzzle.  Using the search architecture and heuristics, a tree containing various states of the given board is traversed.  It implements the A* (Manhattan) search, breadth first search, as well as depth first search.  A priority queue is used to maintain a frontier set of nodes.
