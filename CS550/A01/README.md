This project creates a TileBoard class to represent a n-puzzle game with basic functions such as comparing
tileboards, flattening the list representation of the board into a tuple, obtain possible actions from the current
tileboard, move the tiles, and check whether the tileboard is solved or not.  It also does error handling to be
sure the user inputs a valid board size or a valid action.
