Systems Programming
===================
This file consists of a semester long group project done in the C++ language.
This is an assembler for the SICXE Assembly Architecture that properly handles errors encountered in the assembly file.  If no errors are found, it outputs both the listing and object files that contain line numbers, addresses, opcodes, operands, comments, machine code, and all header/text/end records.
