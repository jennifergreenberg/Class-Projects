This project uses multithreaded processes to emulate the Lucy and Ethel candy factory scenario.  Using POSIX unnamed semaphores and POSIX threads, this program simulates two producers (crunchy frog bites and escargot suckers) and two consumers (Lucy and Ethel).  Constraints placed on the candy production are that no more than 3 frog bites are allowed on the conveyer belt of 10 slots.  In the end, a total of 100 candies are produced and consumed.  The program takes in optional command line arguments that specify the number of milliseconds for each producer/consumer.  The output of this program shows what is on the belt and what action was applied (consumed/produced).  There is also a final production report once the program is done running.
